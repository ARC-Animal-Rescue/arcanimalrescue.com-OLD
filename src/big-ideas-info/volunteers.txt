RETURN VOLUNTEERS TO ACTIVE DUTY IN SHELTERS ACROSS AMERICA.  In response to the pandemic, almost all shelters barred or limited volunteers at a time when they lost a large percentage of staff.  As a result, many shelter animals died.  Our coalition is calling for ALL shelters to ACTIVELY return the status of volunteers to pre-pandemic levels without overly burdensome restrictions.  For example:  walking a dog outside should not require a mask.  Allowing volunteers inside to take photographs of pets to share to rescues who are are desperately trying to save the pets life should be a priority.
