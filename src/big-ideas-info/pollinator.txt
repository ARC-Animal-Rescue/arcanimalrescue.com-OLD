POLLINATOR CORRIDOR:  Grass roots participation of residents and businesses dedicating  micro-climate landscaping areas on each property to Native Plants to provide nurseries and native food buffets for our butterflies, birds, bees and other native flora and fauna. Fill the air with rare butterflies and birds!  This project emphasizes the importance of urban habitat corridors replenished with native plants to benefit bees and other pollinators.
