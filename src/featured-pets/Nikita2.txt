<h1>Adopt Nikita!</h1><br>
This ADORABLE little girl is super CHILD FRIENDLY, AND she is great with other doggies, kitties and ALL people!  She is truly the Golden Tri-fecta when it comes to family pets.  AND she is absolutely unique- in my FORTY YEARS of rescue I have NEVER seen a "Miniature Chocolate Lab". 

Chocolate labs, as you well know, are amazing family pets- they're good natured, friendly, intelligent and loving.  But NO ONE breeds miniatures. 
Nikkita is certainly a one-of-a-kind little girl!  She is our staff and volunteer favorite, so we are ALL working very, very hard to identify the exact RIGHT FUR-ever home for her.  ;-)
