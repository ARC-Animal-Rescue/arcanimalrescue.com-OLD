                On top of old Yeller
                 
                
                 
                All covered with fleas
                 
                
                 
                I lost track of WOOFERS
                 
                
                 
                When somebody sneezed
                 
                
                 
                He slipped off his collar
                 
                
                 
                He chewed through his lead
                 
                
                 
                And then my poor Woofers
                 
                
                 
                Dashed off at warp speed
                 
                
                 
                He ran round the corner
                 
                
                 
                Through river and dale
                 
                
                 
                Attacking some Yorkies
                 
                
                 
                And raising some Hale
                 
                
                 
                Approaching I nabbed him
                 
                
                 
                But he put up a fight
                 
                
                 
                I shouted, “I’ll miss you!”
                 
                
                 
                As he ran out of sight
                 
                
                 
                So when you walk your doggie
                 
                
                 
                Check everything twice
                 
                
                 
                Hold on to his harness
                 
                
                 
                Please take my advice!

                <pre>If we could rescue the animals,
                 
                Just imagine it,
                 
                
                 
                Rescuing a puppy from the streets,
                 
                Imagine saving a poor horsey,
                 
                Finding some lost turtle,
                 
                What a neat achievement it would be
                 
                
                 
                If we give homes to the animals,
                 
                Find them moms and dads,
                 
                Maybe give them kids to be around,
                 
                We’d find a home for every bunny,
                 
                
                 
                Help to pay the money,
                 
                
                 
                Help to make sure food and toys abound
                 
                
                 
                We would make sure that every kitty”s happy
                 
                And we”d find homes for snakes and hamsters too
                 
                If people asked us,
                 
                Can you find an ostrich?
                 
                We’d say, “Prepostrich!”
                 
                But we”d do!!
                 
                
                 
                And next we go out finding pets abandoned
                 
                
                 
                The ones so scared and hiding on their own
                 
                
                 
                We”d spay and neuter to reduce their numbers 
                 
                
                 
                And then we find them all forever homes
                 
                
                 
                
                 
                If we could save all our furry friends, 
                 
                Every animal,
                 
                Think of all the good things we could do
                 
                If we could rescue the animals
                 
                
                 
                Save all the animals
                 
                Find forever homes for
                 
                All—EVERY animal
                 
                Just think of all the happy moms and dads and kids and pets there’d be!!</pre>
